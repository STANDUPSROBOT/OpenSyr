# OpenSyr
Open Source Automatic Syringe pump project

### Next Milestones for V2 (Mid February)
- [X] Design the backend (python process) as an API (REST controller + model)
- [X] React Js GUI, REST com (if motivated)
- [X] Get a name for each module (cf Falcon 9 -> Falcon Heavy from SpaceX)
- [ ] Think about continuous motor (advice from M. Taix)
- [X] Think about vertical extensions (syringe pair over the previous one)

#### Code list
- [X] create the calibration phase


### Notes
Possible solution for the cell gravity is to buffer the cells in the tube (volume == syringe).


### Communication
- [ ] complete README 
- [ ] report = paper 
- [ ] correct some Biologic facts
- [ ] complete the Biologic references (with INSERM help)
